Welcome to Clyra, an educational ecosystem designed to transform learning through immersive, creative experiences adapted to the level of each classroom.

**Three levels of depth for each teacher and their students**
Each teacher can decide how deeply they want to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their classroom, choosing between three levels of involvement:

  <Accordion title="Character Profiles (Text-to-Text)" defaultOpen icon="newspaper" iconType="duotone">
    The first layer focuses on creating [character profiles](/fichadepersonaje/descripciongeneral), helping students retain historical concepts through imagination. Using AI for text generation, students learn to:

    - Formulate effective prompts.
    - Validate and correct the information obtained.
    - Develop their critical thinking and creativity.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Character Cards (Text-to-Image)" defaultOpen icon="cards-blank" iconType="duotone">
    The second layer offers visual immersion: based on the profiles created, students generate images of their characters and their historical environment using AI. This way, they not only see their learning reflected, but also:

    - Re-prompt to improve the quality and historical coherence of the images.
    - Introduce gamification elements similar to collectible cards.
    - Can build a visual gallery of characters at the end of the unit.

  <Accordion title="Immersive Activities (Advanced AI Experiences)" defaultOpen icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone">
    The third layer takes the experience further, offering activities that integrate more advanced technologies:

    - Creation of audio where characters narrate their experiences (text-to-audio).
    - Design of Custom GPTs that respond in first person as if they were the historical characters.
    - Development of other interactive experiences such as role-playing, simulations, or interviews with the characters.
