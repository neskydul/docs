      <Tab title="Instructions">
        Using the data that the student has collected in their [Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata) table, a small list will be created.

        - Period
        - Technology
        - Environment
        - Society
        - Key Innovation

        - **Period**:
          - Lower Paleolithic (≈ 450,000 BCE)
        - **Technology**:
          - Acheulean Industry (symmetrical bifaces of flint and quartzite)
          - Occasional use of wooden hammers.
        - **Environment**:
          - Savanna interspersed with gallery forest
          - Alternation of dry/wet seasons.
        - **Society**:
          - Bands of 20-30 individuals
          - Basic cooperation
          - Extended care for offspring
          - Protolinguistic communication (gestures, vocalizations).
        - **Key innovation**:
          - Intermittent control of fire in natural hearths: longer nights of activity, defense against predators.

  <Step title="Create the prompt for AI." iconType="duotone" stepNumber="2" titleSize="h2">
    To develop a quality **Historical Context** using Artificial Intelligence, it is essential that students learn to formulate a **good prompt**: a clear and precise message that indicates exactly what we want the AI to write.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Instructions">
        1. **Present the objective**:\
           Explain that you want to write a **short paragraph** that describes what life was like in a specific era, based **only** on the data they already have.
        2. **Give clear instructions**:\
           The message should explicitly ask that:
           - Only the provided information is used (without inventing or adding external data).
           - It is written in a specific format and style.
        3. **Specify format and style**:
           - **Length**: A single paragraph of 90 to 120 words.
           - **Tone**: Informative and precise, written in third person.
           - **Beginning**: The paragraph should start with a specific phrase such as "In the Lower Paleolithic...".
           - **Information integration**: Do not repeat the list of data or cite sources; everything should be smoothly integrated into the text.
        4. **Always use simple and direct language in the prompt** to avoid misinterpretations.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Example">
        Write a paragraph titled **"Real historical context"** for a character profile about Prehistory.\
        Use **only** the facts from the following list (do not add external information):

        - Period: Lower Paleolithic (≈ 450,000 BCE)
        - Technology: Acheulean Industry (symmetrical bifaces of flint and quartzite); occasional use of wooden hammers.
        - Environment: Savanna interspersed with gallery forest; alternation of dry/wet seasons.
        - Society: Bands of 20-30 individuals; basic cooperation, extended care for offspring; protolinguistic communication (gestures, vocalizations).
        - Key innovation: Intermittent control of fire in natural hearths: longer nights of activity, defense against predators.

        **Format and style**:

        - A single paragraph of 90-120 words.
        - Informative and precise tone, third person.
        - Start with "In the Lower Paleolithic...".
        - Do not repeat the list or cite the source, integrate everything into continuous prose.

  <Step title="Critical review" iconType="duotone" stepNumber="3" titleSize="h2">
    The goal is for students to learn to critically review AI-generated content and identify errors by comparing the generated text with the original sources.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Instructions">
        - **Compare point by point with the original information**:
          - Check if the text includes **all the data** provided:
            - Period
            - Technology
            - Environment
            - Society
            - Key innovation
          - Verify if those data are reflected correctly, using the [Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata) and the textbook as references.
        - **Detect unauthorized information**:
          - Check if the text adds information that **does not appear** in their [Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata) or in the book.
          - If they detect additions (such as inventions, events, technologies, or customs not mentioned in the book), they should consider it an **error**.
        - **Identify historical errors**:
          - Check if the text includes **anachronisms** or incorrect data (for example, mentioning pottery in the Lower Paleolithic).
        - **Record errors in an** [**Error Table**](/en/charactersheet/resources#error-table)
