Once the **Historical Context** has been written and the **Historical Data** collected, the next step is to create the **Character Profile**, which includes their name, role, age, location, species, and a symbolic motto or phrase.

This profile will be **generated with AI** based on the already validated data, and subsequently **reviewed and corrected by the student** if necessary.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Baseline information." iconType="duotone" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h2">
    ### The student must have ready:

    - The **[Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata)** table.
    - The previously generated **[Historical Context](/en/charactersheet/historicalcontext)**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the prompt for AI." iconType="duotone" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h2">
    To develop a quality **Historical Context** using Artificial Intelligence, it is essential that students learn to formulate a **good prompt**: a clear and precise message that indicates exactly what we want the AI to write.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Instructions">
        1. **Present the objective**:\
           Explain that you want to create a **fictional profile** of a character who could have lived in that era, **using only the information already obtained** ([Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata) and [Historical Context](/en/charactersheet/historicalcontext)).
        2. **Give clear instructions**:\
           The message should explicitly indicate that:
           - Only the provided information can be used.
           - You should not invent or add external or anachronistic data.
           - The result should have a specific format with defined fields.
        3. **Specify format and style**:
           - **Invented name**: with primitive sound, without modern references.
           - **Motto or symbolic phrase**: a brief poetic or metaphorical description of their role or identity.
           - **Location**: realistic, consistent with the historical period (for example, East Africa in the Lower Paleolithic).
           - **Role**: a specific function within the group (carver, gatherer, guide, caretaker...).
           - **Species**: must correspond to the human species of the period (e.g., Homo erectus).
           - **Age**: adjusted to their role, taking into account the life expectancy of the time.

           **Style**:
           - Clear and direct language.
           - No modern names, unnecessary technicalities, or out-of-period embellishments.
           - Simple but expressive tone, suitable for a character profile.
        4. **Always use simple and direct language in the prompt** to avoid misinterpretations.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Example">
        I need you to generate a **fictional character profile** set in the Lower Paleolithic.\
        Use **only** the following historical data and the context I include, without adding external or anachronistic information.

        **Historical data**:

        - Period: Lower Paleolithic (â‰ˆ 450,000 BCE)
        - Technology: Acheulean Industry (flint and quartzite bifaces, wooden hammers)
        - Environment: Savanna with gallery forests, dry/wet seasons
        - Society: Bands of 20-30 individuals, basic cooperation, offspring care, gestural and vocal communication
        - Key innovation: Intermittent fire control
        - Species: Homo erectus

        **Historical context**:\
        In the Lower Paleolithic, around 450,000 BCE, the first Homo erectus mastered the Acheulean industry: symmetrical bifaces carved in flint or quartzite, struck with wooden hammers.\
        These bands, composed of just 20 or 30 individuals, moved through a savanna dotted with gallery forests and alternated camps according to the dry or wet seasons.\
        Their communication was basically gestural and vocal; even so, they cooperated to care for offspring and to take advantage of carrion or large prey.\
        Fire control was still intermittent: natural fires that extended nighttime activity and kept predators away.

        **Profile format**:

        - Name (invented, without modern references)
        - Motto or symbolic phrase (e.g., "The stone striker")
        - Location (realistic and consistent with the period)
        - Role within the group (carver, guide, caretaker...)
        - Species (Homo erectus)
        - Estimated age (consistent with the role and era)

  <Step title="Critical review" iconType="duotone" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h2">
    The goal is for students to learn to critically review AI-generated content and identify errors by comparing the generated text with the original sources.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Instructions">
        - **Compare point by point with the original information**:
          - Check if the text includes **all the data** provided:
            - Period
            - Technology
            - Environment
            - Society
            - Key innovation
          - Verify if those data are reflected correctly, using the [Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata) and the textbook as references.
        - **Detect unauthorized information**:
          - Check if the text adds information that **does not appear** in their [Historical Data](/en/charactersheet/historicaldata) or in the book.
          - If they detect additions (such as inventions, events, technologies, or customs not mentioned in the book), they should consider it an **error**.
        - **Identify historical errors**:
          - Check if the text includes **anachronisms** or incorrect data (for example, mentioning pottery in the Lower Paleolithic).
        - **Record errors in an** [**Error Table**](/en/charactersheet/resources#error-table)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Example">
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr />

        </thead>

        </table>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-Prompt" iconType="duotone" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h2">
    - If there are small errors, the student can correct the text directly.
    - If there are many errors, it is recommended to redo the prompt with better adjustments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Character Profile" icon="newspaper" iconType="duotone" titleSize="h2">
    Students will add the final profile to the Character Profile.
