Once the **Historical Context** and the **Character Profile** have been created, the next step is to write a brief narrative **in first person**, as if the character were speaking directly from their world. This narrative helps students connect emotionally with the past and exercise their imagination within rigorous historical limits.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Baseline information." iconType="duotone" stepNumber="1" titleSize="h2">
    ### The student must have ready:

    - The previously generated **historical context**.
    - The **Character Profile**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the prompt for AI." iconType="duotone" stepNumber="2" titleSize="h2">
    To develop a quality **Historical Context** using Artificial Intelligence, it is essential that students learn to formulate a **good prompt**: a clear and precise message that indicates exactly what we want the AI to write.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Instructions">
        1. **Present the objective**:\
           Explain that you want to create a **short text** where the character expresses themselves in their own voice, relating actions, thoughts, or sensations of daily life in their historical context.
        2. **Give clear instructions**:\
           The message should explicitly indicate that:
           - Only information from the **historical context** and the **character profile** can be used.
           - The result must be **narrated in first person**.
           - The style should be **sensory and evocative**, avoiding modern language.
           - There should be no anachronisms or inventions outside the period.
        3. **Specify format and style**:
           - **Length**: 90 to 130 words.
           - **Tone**: Narrative, poetic, or intimate; not technical or academic.
           - **Narrator**: First person singular (I).
           - **Language**: Sensory (uses sounds, textures, images, emotions).
           - **Content**: Must indirectly reflect the data from the profile and context (for example, show the use of fire or the manufacture of bifaces in action, not in list form).
        4. **Always use simple and direct language in the prompt** to avoid misinterpretations.
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Example">
        I need you to write a brief first-person narrative for a fictional character from the Lower Paleolithic.\
        Use only the historical context and profile data that I include below. Do not add external information.

        **Historical context**:\
        In the Lower Paleolithic, around 450,000 BCE, the first Homo erectus mastered the Acheulean industry: symmetrical bifaces carved in flint or quartzite, struck with wooden hammers.\
        These bands, composed of just 20 or 30 individuals, moved through a savanna dotted with gallery forests and alternated camps according to the dry or wet seasons.\
        Their communication was basically gestural and vocal; even so, they cooperated to care for offspring and to take advantage of carrion or large prey.\
        Fire control was still intermittent: natural fires that extended nighttime activity and kept predators away.

        **Character profile**:\
        Name: Uldar\
        Motto: The stone striker\
        Location: Omo Valley, East Africa\
        Role: Biface carver and route guide\
        Species: Homo erectus\
        Age: 18 years

        **Style**:

        - Text in first person.
        - Evocative and sensory.
        - Between 90 and 130 words.
        - Avoid technicalities and modern names.
        - Reflect thoughts or everyday actions of the character in their natural environment.

  <Step title="Critical review" iconType="duotone" stepNumber="3" titleSize="h2">
    The goal is for students to learn to critically review AI-generated content and identify errors by comparing the generated text with the original sources.

    - **Compare point by point with the original information**:
      - Check if the text includes **all the data** provided:
        - Period
        - Technology
        - Environment
        - Society
        - Key innovation
      - Verify if those data are reflected correctly, using the [Historical Data](datos-historicos.md) and the textbook as references.
    - **Detect unauthorized information**:
      - Check if the text adds information that **does not appear** in their [Historical Data](datos-historicos.md) or in the book.
      - If they detect additions (such as inventions, events, technologies, or customs not mentioned in the book), they should consider it an **error**.
    - **Identify historical errors**:
      - Check if the text includes **anachronisms** or incorrect data (for example, mentioning pottery in the Lower Paleolithic).
    - **Record errors in an** [**Error Table**](../tabla-de-errores.md)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-Prompt" iconType="duotone" stepNumber="4" titleSize="h2">
    - If there are small errors, the student can correct the text directly.
    - If there are many errors, it is recommended to redo the prompt with better adjustments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Narrative" icon="newspaper" iconType="duotone" titleSize="h2">
    Students will add the final Narrative to the Character Profile.
