The **Character Profile** is the first major step in our educational journey through time. Its goal is to help us **understand a historical period from the inside**, **empathizing** with a character who could have lived in that era.\
This approach will allow us not only to learn historical facts, but to **feel** what life was like at that time.

The creation of the Character Profile is divided into several stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extraction of Historical Data">

    </Tip>
    Before creating any character, we need **a solid knowledge base**.\
    For this:

    - **Source:** The student must extract historical data **from the official textbook** or from the indicated reference material.
    - **Format:** The data should be filled in a **historical data table** provided (attached in the documentation).
    - **Objective:** Ensure that all subsequent work is built on real, verified, and coherent information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generation of Historical Context">

    <Tip>

    </Tip>
    With the historical data already organized:

    - We will start **using Artificial Intelligence** to generate an initial **narrative historical context**.
    - **Activity:** We will learn to **prompt correctly**: sending the historical data to the AI to generate a text that places our character in their world.
    - **Verification:**
      - The student must **review** the generated historical context.
      - Compare the text with the historical data table.
      - Detect and correct **anachronisms** or **errors** through new instructions (re-prompting) or manual corrections.
      - The process will be repeated until a **solid and consistent historical context** is obtained.

    With a solid context:

    - The character will be brought to life through AI:
      - **Name** appropriate to the time period and culture.
      - **Brief description** defining their essential characteristics.
      - **Location** based on a real archaeological site from the era.
      - **Age** consistent with the assigned social or professional role.
      - **Species** if applicable (for example, Homo sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis, etc., in prehistoric times).
      - **Role** or **occupation**, according to both the era and their age (e.g.: apprentice, hunter, healer, scribe).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creation of Personal Narrative">

    </Tip>
    Finally:

    - The student will use AI to generate a **first-person narrative**: the character will tell a fragment of their life.
    - **Narrative rules:**
      - Literary licenses will be allowed to make the story attractive.
      - However, **all historical data must be correct**.
      - Each error found in the generated text must be **corrected**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Quality Control

  - Students should note each detected error in an Error Table.
  - This table will be used later to analyze the reliability of AI-generated content and to develop critical thinking.
  - Access the Error Table template [here](/fichadepersonaje/recursos#tabla-de-errores)
