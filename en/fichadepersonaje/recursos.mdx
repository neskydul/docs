In this section, you will find the necessary materials to complete the historical character creation activity.

Both resources are available in **Google Slides** format. Each template already includes **text placeholders** in the correct locations, which the student must progressively **replace** with the content generated during the activity.

## How to use the templates?

- Each template is published **in view-only mode**.
- To use it, the student must:
  1. **Open the corresponding link**.
  2. **Click on "File" â†’ "Make a copy"** to save it to their own Google account.
  3. **Work on their copy**, replacing the example text with their own content.

<Info>
  **Important note**:

  It is not possible to edit the original file directly. Each student must work on their **own personal copy**.
